# TSP

Compulsory assignment for the course 'Optimization' autumn 2019.

The assignments objective was to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using different algorithms and then compare the results to find the most optimal solution. The algorithms used for phase one, the initial solution, are “Random Method”, “Iterative Random Method” and “Greedy Method”. And in phase two, the optimized solution, “Greedy Improvement” and “Greedy Random Algorithm”.

> **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):** <br> _“ Given a list of cities and the distance between each city. What is the shortest possible route visiting each city once and then returning to the origin city? ”_
